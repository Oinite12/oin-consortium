            <p><b>Announcement: </b>
                Hello Consortium members! We have set up a work-in-progress version of our new document
                system! Currently, we have a few pages set up for you to check out to provide some
                feedback with. Reports about any sort of glitches have been made and we are currently
                looking into the issue. Please bear with us as we fix any problems you may encounter.
                Any and all feedback is truly appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are currently in the process of digitizing existing documents for this new document system!
                If you would like to contribute, please send your digitized version of any currently existing
                document to Server Administrator Oinite12#2112. Note that any alteration of the
                original document will be noticed and reprimanded; this is serious business, I tell you!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for heeding this announcement!
            </p>
