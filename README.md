# The OIN Consortium Document System
This is a repository holding the OIN Consortium Document System, a series of documents held by the Consortium that can be read with the document viewer.
## What is the OIN Consortium?
Operating beyond the boundaries of mere universes, The Oinmonster Inhibition Nexus Consortium is an interuniversal alliance of Multiverse-faring groups dedicated to the hiding and documentation of 'Oinmonsters', monstrous creatures of varying forms and properties. The dangerous virality of the Oinmonsters require them to be hidden from the Multiverse as much as possible, let the entire Multiverse drown in the powerful infection.
Our mission is threefold:
- **Obscure:** The Consortium locates any reported Oinmonster and either capture them or escort the population within the universe the Oinmonster is located in.
- **Inspect:** The Consortium observes the properties and behavior of the captured or isolated Oinmonster, leading to the third mission:
- **Notate:** The Consortium records any observations about the Oinmonster to form 'handling procedures' that keep the Oinmonster in check and so protect the rest of the Multiverse.
## Okay, enough pretending. What is the OIN Consortium?
It's just a silly little SCP Foundation rip-off that I, Oiniteoderfla12, created for my fictional world. A result of many many *many* friend group inside jokes, its inclusions makes those inside jokes canonical to my fictional world one way or another?
I've always had an interest in the 'official government document' style of writing the SCP Wiki brings to the table (although the SCP Foundation is non-governmental), and I wanted to incorporate that style of writing into my fictional world. 
This is all just for harmless fun!
