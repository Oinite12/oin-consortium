                <span class="glitchedText">A</span>nomalous force coinciding with Virgetan's destruction of 
                Olliverse Alpha which catalysed the process. 
                No model of the si<span class="glitchedText">t</span>uation should have resulted in this. 
                The root cause must be determined.

            <p><b>Description: </b>
                <span class="tag-redacted">[REDACTED]</span> into V<span class="glitchedText">i</span>rgetan's conjuration, the rate and magnitude of 
                destruction of universes abruptly increased by a factor of <span class="tag-redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, 
                lasting for <span class="tag-redacted">[REDACTED]</span> before returning to the expected levels for the scenario. 
                Lingering damage to reality was s<span class="glitchedText">u</span>bsequently detected, and can still be detected now. 
                The result of this sudden change resulted in an amount of casualties <span class="tag-redacted">[REDACTED]</span>
                times greater than modelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cause of this phenomenon is completely unknown. 
                Though it does not appear directly related to Virgetan, 
                the po<span class="glitchedText">s</span>sibility cannot be ruled out. 
                It must be determined to model the potential for a relapse of such an event elsewhere. 
                Analyses of the resulting damage to reality reveal ties to a person located in 
                certain Realities of Imp<span class="glitchedText">o</span>rtance, identifiable by a specific hairpin and outfit 
                (please refer to attached image). This person possesses anomalous capabilities with 
                similar reality signatures to those invo<span class="glitchedText">l</span>ved in this phenomenon.
